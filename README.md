### ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup

First, move data to your scratch directory (make sure to replace username with your actual `izar` username):

```bash
mkdir -p /scratch/izar/username/netml/
rsync -ah --info=progress2 /home/ogut/data/ /scratch/izar/username/netml/
```

Second, create virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
module load gcc python
virtualenv --system-site-packages venvs/netml
source venvs/netml/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Third, authenticate yourself with W&B (if not done already), follow this [quick start quide](https://docs.wandb.ai/quickstart/).

### üèãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Training
To train the model, first check [train config](configs/train.yaml) and adjust the parameters as needed. Then, run the training script:

```bash
python train.py 
```

When you want to overwrite some default config setting, you can do so as follows:

```bash
python train.py debug=True data.subset=500
```

If you are using logging to W&B, you can view the training progress in the main metrics [overview page](https://wandb.ai/ludekcizinsky/seizure-prediction/workspace?nw=whk83ic2jml).

You can also submit a job to the cluster using the provided Slurm script:

```bash
sbatch train.slurm
```

### Submitting to Kaggle (via CLI)

Make sure you have kaggle CLI installed:

```bash
pip install kaggle
```

Then, go to Kaggle and under settings, create a new API token. This will download a file called `kaggle.json`. By default the CLI looks for it under `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json`. Therefore, create the directory and then copy from your local machine the json file. Finally, make sure the file is not world-readable:

```bash
chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
```

To verify that the CLI is working, run:

```bash
kaggle competitions submissions -c epfl-network-machine-learning-2025
```

which lists all our (as a team) submissions to the competition.


Finally, to submit the predictions, run (make sure to replace `run_erec0tvb` with the name of the run you want to submit, and `My submission message` with run_id, so we can look up its details in wandb):

```bash
kaggle competitions submit \
  -c epfl-network-machine-learning-2025 \
  -f submissions/run_erec0tvb.csv \
  -m "run_erec0tvb"
```
